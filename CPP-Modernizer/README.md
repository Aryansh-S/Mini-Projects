# CPP-Modernizer

Many OJs (USACO as a prime example) make C++11 available as their only "modern" C++. 
This is problematic due to many of the recently-developed conveniences in the standard (from C++14, C++17, and even C++20). 
To largely alleviate this issue, this repository collates all of these convenient accessories in one place.
